1. Divide encoder and classifier
    - change model : done
    - change training routine : done
    - change peaker interface : done
    - train on data : done
    - change test routine : done
    - add integrated gradients function with testing routine : done
    - test on data : done
2. Add user input features to model
    - new file with additional features for model
    - peaker takes that as additional input file
